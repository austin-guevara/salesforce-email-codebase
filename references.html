TO DO 
- Fix CTA button 
- Fix background image module 
- Test Margin for element spacing (Outlook)


NOTES TO ADD TO README

1) Mobile First
- using min-width over max-width
2) Multiple Style Blocks
- Gmail has a weird ?? byte limit for CSS in the head, so we prioritize important styles first and split the CSS into multiple </style/> blocks.

3) Progressive Enhancements
4) Manual Outlook adjustments
- any responsive desktop styles need to be duplicated because Outlook strips the first declaration
- any padding needs to be added to the ghost tables

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Minify css

2) Run through inliner (what edge cases is this for?)
